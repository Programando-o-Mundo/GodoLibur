# How to Contribute to the Project

First and foremost, we greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to the GodoLibur project. If you have any questions about the contribution process, please don't hesitate to create an issue to seek clarification. With that said, here are the various ways in which you can contribute to this project.

## Create Short Demonstrations

Creating short demonstrations is one of the most valuable ways to help our project grow. It would be highly appreciated if you could produce demos that showcase how to utilize this library. Currently, the only available demonstration is for "Ao Oni," but we are unable to share its source code due to copyright restrictions. We are actively working on developing a downloadable demo that people can play and use as a reference, but this may take some time.

If you're interested in contributing by creating demos, here's how you can get started:

* Fork the Project: Start by forking the GodoLibur repository to create your own working copy.
* Establish a /demos folder at the project's root directory: In this folder is were all demos are keept.
* Begin your project within the /demos folder by creating a subfolder with the name of your demo.
* Develop your demonstration: It doesn't have to be a complete game, it just need to effectively utilizes one or more of the library components.
* Submit a Pull Request: When you are confident that your code is ready, submit a pull request to the main branch of the original project. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes, including the rationale behind them.
* Participate in Reviews: Be prepared to engage in discussions and address any feedback or questions that arise during the review process. Collaboration with other contributors can lead to improved code quality.
* Finalize Your Contribution: Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, your changes will be merged into the main project. Congratulations, you've successfully contributed a new functionality to GodoLibur!

Please ensure that you provide information about which library functionalities you have utilized in your demo.

## Correcting Mistakes

If you come across bugs, errors, or issues in the library's code or documentation, you can help improve the project by following these simplified steps:

* Create an Issue: Start by going to the "Issue tab" and create a new issue. Clearly describe the problem you've encountered, and if possible, provide a minimal reproduction of the error. This will help any maintainer of the project understand the problem and other.
* Collaborate: Engage in discussions on the issue thread. Be prepared to provide additional information or clarify details if requested by project maintainers or other contributors.

## Adding New Functionalities

Expanding the functionality of GodoLibur is another valuable way to contribute to the project. If you have ideas for new features or improvements to the library, here's how you can go about adding them:

* Fork the Project: Start by forking the GodoLibur repository to create your own working copy.
* Create a New Branch: It's a good practice to create a new branch for your feature or enhancement. This helps keep your changes isolated and organized. Obs.: Make the name of the branch something like: "feat:{name of the feature}"
* Develop Your Feature: Write code that implements the new functionality or improves existing ones. Make sure to document your code adequately to help other contributors understand your changes.
* Test Thoroughly: Test your new functionality to ensure it works correctly and does not introduce any regressions. Writing unit tests and integration tests is highly recommended.
* Submit a Pull Request: When you are confident that your code is ready, submit a pull request to the main branch of the original project. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes, including the rationale behind them.
* Participate in Reviews: Be prepared to engage in discussions and address any feedback or questions that arise during the review process. Collaboration with other contributors can lead to improved code quality.
* Finalize Your Contribution: Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, your changes will be merged into the main project. Congratulations, you've successfully contributed a new functionality to GodoLibur!

If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers. Your contributions can greatly enhance the library and make it even more valuable to users. Thank you for your dedication to improving GodoLibur!
