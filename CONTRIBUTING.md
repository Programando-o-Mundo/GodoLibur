# How to contribute to the project

First of all, thank you for taking into consideration helping this project, and if you have any other questions regarding the process of contributing to GodoLibur, please post it as an issue. With 
that out of the way here is all of the possible things you can do to contribute to this project.

## Create short demonstrations

By far the most helpful, it would be really nice seeing people create demonstrations for other people of how to use this library. Right now the only demonstration we have is the "Ao Oni" one, but
I can't leak the source code because of copyrighted material. I am trying to work in my free time for a demo that people can atually download, play and use as a guideline, but that may take some time.

If you want to contribute by creating demos, here is how you can do it:

* Fork this project
* Create a ```/demos``` folder in the root of the project
* Start your project in the demos folder, by creating another folder with the name of your demo.
* Create the demo
* Push the demo to your forked project.
* Create a pull request to the *main* branch in this repository

Obs.: Please make sure to inform which functionalities of the library you utilize.
